# Univariate Analysis
## Categorical column
- 'MSZoning' have around 80 percent of  RL(Residential Low Density). It need more analysis. 
- 'Street' Column has around 100 percent of single data. I'm droping it.
- "LotShape"(General shape of property)have somehow skew data. Need more analysis. 
- "HouseStyle" I think it might be important feature.
- "ExterQual"(quality of the material on the exterior) around 60 percent are average, but it might be useful feature.
